# When debug is turned on, errors will be more verbose (outputted
# directly in the web view). The about-page will also die if the

# This setting lets you specify custom about pages.
# The suffix: '_my' will look for a file called

# Below are two database specific configurations. This is necessary
# because the database schemas differs slightly between the different
# systems, and the built in functions differs a bit also. This
# configuration should be left untouched in most use cases.
#
# tbl_ are mappings to the database tables
# fun_ are various database engine specific built in functions
